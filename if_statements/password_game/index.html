  <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
  <P>
    It has to be capitalized the same way as the PassWord variable was set, otherwise it won't make a match.

  <h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
  <p>
    I used == to compare, since the prompt automatically takes the input as a String. The === would have also worked because the password is a String and the user input is a String from the prompt operator as well. The single = would not have worked because it assigns the right to the left, rather than checking for equality on both sides.
