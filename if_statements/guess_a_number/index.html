  <h2>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h2>
  <p>
    Without parsing the input, == works because it converts the string to a number before it compares. === would not work, because it also compares types.
  </p>

  <h2>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?</h2>
  <p>
    Either one works in this case because the input is converted to an Integer before it's compared, so the value and the type match.
  </p>

  <h2>What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
  <p>
    The == operator compares values and tries to convert the values to match each other. The === operator is more strict because it doesn't try to convert the type of Object on the right side. If the type doesn't match, then it doesnt get to the point of comparing values and determines false.
  </p>

  <h2>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)?</h2>
  <p>
    It makes more sense in this case to leave it as a String because the it works just as well, but gives flexibility to change the number to a String and it will still work.
