  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h2>
  <p>
    Prediction: It will show an invalid triangle because it won't be able to return as true when comparing an NaN.
  </p>
  <p>
    Actual:
  </p>
  <h2>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h2>
  <p>
    Prediction: If one of the legs is 0, it'll show as an invalid triangle, but the program should still run. If two legs are 0, it will still show invalid. If three are 0, it should still show invalid because all comparisons will be false.
  </p>
  <p>
    Actual:
  </p>
  <h2>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h2>
  <p>
    Prediction: The program should still work as expected, showing either valid or invalid.
