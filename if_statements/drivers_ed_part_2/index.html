  <h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
  <p>
    No, the order does not matter. It only satisfies one of the conditions and then gives the response.
  </p>
  <h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
  <p>
    The age cannot be both less than 16 AND greater than 21, so it'll never be true.
  </p>
  <h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, it still makes sense. The variables just hold the numbers, so they work the same. It makes it easier to change the ages though, if need be.
