  <h2>What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?</h2>
  <p>
    They both seem roughly equivalent. For uses a single line, while a while loops is slightly more verbose, but both wrok similarly.

  <h2>Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>
    I didn't use either; I instead used a != operator to run the loop while it doesn't equal the correct password.
