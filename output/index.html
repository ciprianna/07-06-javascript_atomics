  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>

  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>An alert is a pop-up window that the user must acknowledge before moving on. A console.log() message is never shown to the user. It stores message content into a log for the developer to view.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>If there was a warning message, such as leaving the page removes clears all unsaved data. An alert might also be used to tell the user that information is missing from a form when they try to submit information.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>If there are multiple alerts on a page, it can probably seem spammy. They should probably be limited to only situations where the user should really be paying attention to something vital.</p>

  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p>
    It wouldn't really make sense to use the console.log() to tell the user information because it's not actively shown on the screen. Instead, it keeps track of the statements in a log that could be looked up if needed.
  </p>

  <h2>What's one way that the console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>
    A log could be a good tool to keep track of analytics on a site. For example, it might track the clicks that a user takes (i.e., from the home page, a large percentage of users click on View X.). Helps track progression of users on a website.
  </p>

  <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks  "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
  <p>
    The console.log() gets run after the user clicks to close the dialog box. I figured this out by inspecting the element in the web browser, and clicking on the console tab at the top. When the page is first loaded, the log is empty, even as the first dialog box appears. After I clicked "OK", the log filled and the second dialog box appeared on the screen. It runs in the order as written in the .js file.
  </p>

  <h2>Questions that I have:</h2>
  <p>
    Slight question on practicality. I haven't seen it used yet. Most cases from general reading seem to be used for debugging, but I have no idea how it would be implemented.
  </p>
  <p>
    Among the same lines, how do we get the log statements to be more useful? I wouldn't want generic things typed into the log (I think?). It makes more sense to use some sort of dynamic thing based on what the user does, like a variable, or a trigger of some sort.  I guess this goes along with seeing more use-cases.
